# Artificial Intelligence on SMT32

This repository provides application examples and resources that demonstrate Artificial Neural Networks running on STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. It illustrates and supports the STM32 AI Wiki articles that can be found here:

<https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_overview>

Use the power of Deep Learning to enhance signal processing performance and increase productivity in your STM32 application. Create and map Artificial Neural Networks onto your STM32 (optimized code automatically generated) instead of building hand-crafted code.
